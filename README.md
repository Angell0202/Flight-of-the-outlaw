**ANALYSIS**

inspired by Rail rush, a rail game the protagonist steals money and Subway surfers also has an impact in this game . The train , obstacles r inspired from it. The running is like a basic endless runner game 

**TASK HIERARCHY**

Main —> Running without hitting the obstacles
Action —>Avoid trains and rocks

Operations —> left right up down

Token—> lanes, rocks, barricades, trains

**LEVELS**

The mountain is the only terrain i will be getting ig…so lightnings and colors and the trees the side decor can be changed to give a feel of diff levels

first it can be a normal rift with no trees

then rift with a some cone trees

if possible some water flow can be made in the middle to bring out some water obstacles…like jumping over the water like in temple run

**HOW THE GAME WORKS**

The player steals the sac full of gold and runs 

at the beginning the goons r seen in the scene and after 5secs the player is alone present in the game…the goons will disappear

The player runs for his life avoiding the obstacles

Old Train — the player can move right or left to avoid
rocks in ground — the player can jump over it our avoid by changing lanes

arc rocks — the player can go under the rock r change lane

gold — its collected and the points of it getting collected is noted in the top right corner 

Distance — The distance the player has ran can be noted too

gems — more valuable than gold [ make it look like a big thing]

powerups in the game can be collected such as

Health drink — the player runs faster (rapid increase in the distance)

invisible potion — once the player gets it the player can run over obstacle without ending the game

as there is no end for this game there is no desired place the player needs to meet to end the game. the gold collected until getting caught is itself considered as a W
